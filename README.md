# EU_GVC
 This is my capstone project for ECON 494: Multinational Corporations at Macaelster College. I worked with another student, Venkat Somala '20. We used the World Input-Output Table to investigate the change in trade through Global Value Chain networks in the EU countries during the union's expansion in the 2000s.
